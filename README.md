# Cost-Sensitive Spam Classification

This project implements a full machine learning pipeline for spam email classification using the [UCI Spambase Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase). It focuses on both maximizing predictive performance (Part A) and minimizing real-world misclassification costs (Part B).

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The classification task was approached in two parts:

### Part A: Accuracy-Optimized Modeling
- Compared multiple models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, k-NN, Neural Network)
- Used **nested cross-validation** to select the best model based on **macro F1-score**
- Final evaluation included accuracy, F1-score, and AUC-ROC on a held-out test set

### Part B: Cost-Sensitive Classification
- Defined a custom cost function with a **10:1 penalty** on false positives (FP = 10, FN = 1)
- Repeated model selection using nested CV with the custom cost as the scoring metric
- Performed **manual tuning** of Random Forest to minimize total misclassification cost
- Achieved a **test cost of 222**, outperforming earlier configurations
